  This plugin has 2 features wrapped into it. The first should be used on an
  issue labeled event, in which you can define a set of labels to act upon. If
  the event is an issue being labelled, this will add your code template with
  info from the issue into the comments. The second action, if setup, is for
  branch pushes. If it sees a certain tag in the commit (which should exist in
  your code template) it will move the issue to the specified ZenHub pipeline.
